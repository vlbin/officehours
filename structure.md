### 💡 basic idea
make it easier for students to recieve answers to common questions in university courses.

### 🏗 structure
the application is divided into courses, where each course can have a number of teachers and students.
students can ask questions for a course and when teachers answer they can make the answer public.
students can upvote unanswered questions to make the teacher acknowledge these first.
